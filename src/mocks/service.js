      description: 'Also known as wet blasting, slurry blasting and liquid honing, vapor blasting is rapidly becoming the number one choice for the highest quality of surface finish. It is a safe and effective way to renew the finish of the aluminum and steel components. Vapor blasting uses a slurry of water, abrasive, inhibitors and compressed air to gently scour away years of corrosion, oxidization, and yellowed clearcoat, leaving a smooth, lustrous finish that will look great for years to come. As the process is safe and dust free other production processes can be carried out simultaneously and close to the blasting operation.  CIC is certified with ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2016 and ISO 45001:2018 which covers all aspects relate to Quality, Environmental and Health & Safety management processes. While there are numerous reasons why wet or vapor blasting is preferable to dry blasting, there are two key features that produce superior results: first, the finish is achieved by flow of water borne abrasive – rather than by impact, which ensures a longer surface life; and secondly, vapor blasting is a dust free and therefore more sterile process, which is a critical factor in the re-surfacing of medical instruments. The ricochet of media is reduced due to the cushioning effect created from the water, which acts as a lubricant between the media and the component surface. As a result, the angle of the media is changed, producing a lapping effect travelling across the surface, resulting in an even satin/ polished finish.',
